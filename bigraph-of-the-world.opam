  "Builds a Bigraph modelling the hierarchy of administrative boundaries, streets and buildings using OpenStreetMap data"
description:
  "This tool builds a Bigraph modelling the hierarchy of administrative boundaries, streets and buildings using OpenStreetMap data. The tool works for any relation on OSM with \"admin_level\", \"id\", and \"name\" tags. When running the tool on a new administrative boundary, querying Overpass API for osm files will take a while due to rate limiting."
